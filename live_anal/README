CentralNotice campaign-based tests are inferred from the log api, descriptions
of each test are stored in a database (in this case, a Google spreadsheet), and
results aggregated from private databases.

There are two jobs which can be scheduled or disabled independently:
* update_specs - suggested interval, 5 minutes
    Sync CN logs to the test description database.  The algorithm is roughly,
If the campaign change would result in a different end-user experience (usually,
an enable or disable event), create or update the new test regime which is begun
by this change.  Also, mark a test matching the previous state as ending at this
time.
* publish_results - suggested 1 or 2 minutes
    Click and contribution results are generated or updated from test cases.
Columns must be present in the results worksheet if they are to be populated,
the scripts do not create their own schema or headers.  See the README.

Jobs will create a lockfile to prevent redundant (and harmful!) concurrency.

Confidence levels should be identical to Thumbtack's "abba" demo.  The first
banner of a campaign becomes the baseline.

Swapping spreadsheet rows or columns will not affect these scripts.

NOTE:
* If the first banner name in a campaign cannot be parsed, the test will not
automatically appear in the list.  A description line may be added by hand.

* Only A/B banner tests are handled correctly.

* If a column on the results sheet is named "Sql", raw queries will be dumped there.


INSTALLATION
=============
On Google Drive:

  Create two worksheets, under a single spreadsheet if desired.  Paste these columns into the column headers line (row 1) of the test descriptions worksheet, and the results worksheet:

    Label, Type, Campaigns, Banners, Start, End, Disabled, Notes

    Label, Banner, Campaign, Language, Country, Start, End, Clicks, Donations, Total, Mean, Mean20, SD, P-value, Improvement, Confidence link, Preview, Updated, Sql-disabled

As root:

  pip install virtualenv MySQL-python

In this directory:

  virtualenv jailenv
  PATH=jailenv/bin pip install simplemediawiki kitchen gdata

  cp config.py.example config.py # and edit
